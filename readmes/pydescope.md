Pydescope is a static analysis tool designed to help developers visualize the internal structure and dependencies of their Python projects. By parsing source code and mapping imports, it generates interactive 2D/3D graphs using NetworkX and PyVis, allowing you to see how different modules interact without the clutter of virtual environments or external libraries.

# 📸 Screenshots
* **Pydescope** renders an interactive dependency map of your codebase. 
* **Nodes** represent Python modules and packages, while 
* **Edges** visualize the directed import relationships between them. 
- The interface supports real-time filtering and neighborhood highlighting to help developers audit project coupling and structural integrity at a glance.

# 🧠 Key Features
- Static Analysis: Scans your .py files and directories to build a map of your code.
- Smart Filtering: Automatically ignores venv, __pycache__, and other non-source directories.
- Interactive Graphs: Generates an HTML-based visualization where you can drag nodes, zoom, and highlight neighborhoods.
- Module Tracking: Distinguishes between package initializations (__init__.py) and standard module files.
- Neighborhood Highlight: Click on a node to highlight its direct dependencies and dim the rest of the graph.
- Search/Filter: Use the built-in search bar (powered by TomSelect) to find specific modules.
- Physics Toggle: Enable or disable the physics engine to stabilize the graph layout.

```

- Pydescope is built with a modular design to ensure efficient parsing and rendering:
* **parser.py**: The engine that walks through your project and identifies Python files.

* **analyser.py**: Scans individual files to extract import statements and determine relationships.

* **graph_builder.py**: Uses NetworkX to create a mathematical representation of the project dependency tree.

* **renderer.py**: Converts the NetworkX graph into an interactive PyVis HTML file.

* **cli.py**: Provides the Command Line Interface for users to interact with the tool.

# 🛠️ Installation
Clone your repository (or navigate to the project folder):

- Prerequisites
Before running Pydescope, ensure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed.

```Bash
cd pydescope
```
## Install in editable mode:
This installs the dependencies and allows you to run the pydescope command directly.

```Bash
pip install -e .
```
## How to Run
Once installed, you can run Pydescope from your terminal.

## Basic Usage
Point Pydescope at any Python project directory you want to analyze:

```Bash
pydescope <path_to_target_project>
Command Options
Output Name: Specify a custom name for your HTML report.
```

```Bash
pydescope <path_to_project> --output my_graph.html
Exclude Directories: Although it ignores venv by default, you can add more exclusions.
```

```Bash
pydescope <path_to_project> --exclude tests,docs
Visualisation Controls
The generated HTML file includes advanced JavaScript-based controls located in the lib/bindings/utils.js file:
```

# 💻 Tech Stack

* **NetworkX** Provides the data structure for the graphs and relationships between the files.
* **PyVis** Takes abstract math from NetworkX and converts it into a beautiful HTML/JS interface, that a user can open in a browser.
* **Click** Handles all CLI logic

# 📝 Notes for Developers

- The project uses repomix for codebase packing and analysis.
- Static assets for the visualization (CSS/JS) are stored in the lib/ directory.
