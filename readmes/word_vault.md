## 🛠️ Project Architecture
This project is divided into two main components to balance real-time user interaction with deep-dive analytical processing:

---

### 1. Interactive Analysis Dashboard (`views.py` & `templates/`)
The **"Frontend"** logic of the project. It provides a real-time interface for users to explore their text data.
* **Dynamic Geospatial Mapping:** Visualizes the "geographic DNA" of a text by pinpointing word origins across a global map using **Folium**.
* **Instant Linguistic KPIs:** Calculates Lexical Diversity (TTR), Overused Words, and Passive Voice detection on the fly.
* **User Vault:** A persistent history system allowing users to search, review, and manage their analysis records securely.

--- 

### 2. Forensic Reporting & Data Engine (`services/` & `models.py`)
The **"Analytical Backend."** This handles the heavy lifting of data management and document generation.
* **Dual-State Storage:** Manages persistent user history in **SQLite** while offloading high-speed etymological lookups to a **DuckDB** OLAP engine.
* **Global Etymology Pipeline:** A custom ingestion layer that maps over 500+ words to global coordinates (Latin, Germanic, Arabic, Sanskrit, and more).
* **Automated Document Generation:** Compiles findings into professional PDF reports (via **WeasyPrint**) and Word documents (**python-docx**) for offline review.

---

## 📁 File Structure
* `word_counter/settings.py`: Core configuration for the Django environment.
* `counter/views.py`: Logic for text processing, regex normalization, and dashboard rendering.
* `counter/services/seed_origins.py`: Data pipeline script for ingesting the global word library.
* `counter/services/word_data.json`: The "Source of Truth" containing 500+ global etymology records.
* `word_vault_analytics.duckdb`: High-performance database for geospatial word lookups.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
* **Python 3.10** (Development Environment)
* **Django 5.2:** For the web framework and user authentication.
* **DuckDB:** For high-performance, local analytical etymology queries.
* **SQLite:** For persistent user history and session management.
* **Folium/Leaflet:** For interactive geospatial mapping.
* **WeasyPrint / python-docx:** For automated forensic report creation.
* **Regex:** For high-speed text normalization and cleaning.

## ⚙️ Installation & Local Usage
To run this project locally:
1. **Clone the repo:** `git clone https://github.com/reory/Word-Counter-Vault.git`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Seed the Global Vault:** `python -m counter.services.seed_origins`
4. **Launch the app:** `python manage.py runserver`

---

## 🧪 Quality Assurance & Testing
This project implements a comprehensive automated testing suite using **Pytest** to ensure data integrity and security across the analytical pipeline.

### Test Coverage:
* **Linguistic Logic:** Validates regex normalization, word frequency calculations, and lexical diversity metrics.
* **Security & Permissions:** Ensures strict object-level access control (e.g., users cannot view or delete others' analysis history).
* **Service Layer & Mocking:** Utilizes `pytest-mock` to simulate **DuckDB** OLAP connections, allowing for high-speed testing without disk I/O dependency.
* **File Extraction:** Verifies robust handling of `.txt`, `.pdf`, and `.docx` uploads using Django's `SimpleUploadedFile`.

### Running Tests locally:
```bash
pytest
```

## 🙏 Acknowledgments
* **Etymology Sources:** Online Etymology Dictionary for root-word tracking.
* **Community:** Thanks to the Django and DuckDB communities for the robust library support.
