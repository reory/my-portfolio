A lightweight, business‑ready analytics tool that transforms raw text into visual insights.  
Upload customer feedback, support tickets, policies, CVs, or any text dataset — the app generates embeddings, reduces them to 2D, clusters them, and reveals hidden patterns.

Perfect for SMEs, councils, charities, and teams that need fast, AI‑powered text understanding without complex infrastructure.

## 🧠 Real‑World Use Cases

This tool is intentionally small but delivers real business value:

- **Customer Feedback Clustering** — identify themes in reviews and surveys  
- **Support Ticket Triage** — group recurring issues and detect outliers  
- **Document Similarity** — map policies, reports, and internal knowledge  
- **Fraud Pattern Discovery** — spot repeated scam wording or anomalies  
- **HR & Recruitment Insights** — compare CVs and job descriptions  
- **SEO Topic Mapping** — visualise content clusters and gaps

# 🧩 How It Works

- Embeddings  
Text is converted into numerical vectors using a SentenceTransformer model.

- Dimensionality Reduction  
High‑dimensional vectors are compressed into 2D using PCA or UMAP.

- Clustering  
KMeans groups similar texts together.

- Visualisation  
The 2D points are plotted so humans can see patterns instantly.

# 📊 Example Workflow

- Upload a CSV of customer comments

- Select the text column

- Choose PCA or UMAP

- Pick number of clusters

- Generate embeddings

- Explore clusters visually

- Download results

## 📝 Example Use Case: Customer Feedback

A business uploads:

feedback.csv
- "Delivery was late again"
- "Website login keeps failing"
- "Customer service was excellent"
- "Refund process is confusing"

The tool reveals clusters like:

- Delivery issues

- Website bugs

- Positive service comments

- Refund complaints

- This helps teams prioritise improvements.

---

# 🛣️ Future Roadmap

- Advanced Embedding Models — Add support for larger or domain‑specific models (legal, financial, medical) to improve clustering accuracy for specialised industries.

- Semantic Search Engine — Allow users to search their dataset using natural language queries powered by embeddings, turning the tool into a mini knowledge explorer.

- Topic Labeling — Automatically assign human‑readable labels to clusters (e.g., “Delivery Issues”, “Refund Complaints”), making insights easier for non‑technical teams.

- Interactive Cluster Editing — Let users merge, rename, or split clusters directly in the UI, enabling custom business workflows and cleaner reporting.
